# Agent compute

Compute is the infrastructure that runs an Agent. The installation operator
selects a Compute Driver; an Agent owner chooses an execution mode supported by
that Driver. You cannot select a different Compute Driver for an individual
Agent. If you are setting up your own first installation, use the
[Kubernetes quickstart](../quickstart.md).

## Choose an execution mode

| Mode          | What runs                                                    | When to choose it                                                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Embedded**  | The Agent's OpenClaw gateway also runs the OpenClaw Harness. | Use it when you need OpenClaw's built-in Harness, or when the installation uses SSH. |
| **Dedicated** | The Agent's gateway connects to a separate Codex Harness.    | Use it for Codex, a ChatGPT service account, or a supported external channel.        |

The mode belongs to the Agent. Its [Configuration](../../reference/configuration.md)
selects the model and Harness, and the two must agree. The HTTP API defaults a
new Agent to embedded when the mode is omitted; the
[first-Agent guide](../first-agent.md) uses embedded OpenClaw on Kubernetes.
See [Harness](../../reference/harness-execution.md#supported-topology) for the
supported model and credential combinations.

## What the bundled Drivers support

| Driver                                                      | Current use                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Kubernetes](../../reference/drivers/kubernetes-compute.md) | Embedded OpenClaw and dedicated Codex. Embedded requires a managed OpenAI API key; dedicated also accepts an issued ChatGPT service account credential. This is the recommended first deployment.                                 |
| [SSH](../../reference/drivers/ssh-compute.md)               | Embedded OpenClaw on operator-managed Linux hosts. The operator supplies the model credential on the host; the control plane does not check model access. Dedicated Codex and platform-managed model credentials are unavailable. |
| [Docker](../../reference/drivers/docker-compute.md)         | Local control-plane development only with the current Agent authentication contract. Its default Docker/Podman profile cannot admit a new Agent deployment.                                                                       |

An optional [Sandbox](../../reference/security/runtime-isolation.md) changes how
a supported workload is contained; it does not replace Compute or choose an
Agent's model.

## Deployment and availability

A deployment creates a new [Agent Revision](agent-revisions.md). The control
plane queues work and can select the new revision while activation is still in
progress. Neither the accepted request nor the console's selected revision
shows live health. Use [Troubleshoot](agent-troubleshoot.md) for status checks.
For a real model response, follow the [local Kubernetes first-Agent guide](../first-agent.md)
or the [production Kubernetes verification guide](../operate/model-verification.md).
For SSH deployments, use the [SSH Driver's credential and verification guidance](../../reference/drivers/ssh-compute.md#credentials-and-supported-boundaries).

On Kubernetes, replacing an embedded Agent can interrupt service before the new
model credential is accepted. If the replacement cannot start, there is no
automatic rollback. See [Harness isolation and activation](../../reference/harness-execution.md#isolation-and-activation)
before using that mode for an availability-sensitive Agent.
