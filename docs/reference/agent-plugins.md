# Agent plugins

Plugins add selected tools or integrations to an Agent. Each Agent saves its
own selections separately from its reusable [Configuration](configuration.md).
Changes apply on the next successful deployment; they do not change another
Agent or an active revision. New Agents start without user-selected plugins.

Use [Configure Agent plugins](../guides/topics/plugins-configure.md) to select,
deploy, and check a plugin. To deploy plugins, the Installation must explicitly
select a bundled [Plugin Driver](drivers/plugin.md); none is selected by
default. OpenClaw Control Plane (OCC) can save a valid request even when the
selected Driver or runtime cannot support it; startup verifies the catalog and
approval policy.

## Current support

Embedded OpenClaw supports the bundled Diffs plugin, enabling or disabling it,
and the `always` and `never` approval policies. Its curated entries currently
return `tools: null`. A saved tool or category policy therefore prevents the
new deployment from becoming ready.

Dedicated Codex Agents translate all four approval modes, plugin-level reviewer
selection, and per-tool or write/destructive category overrides for selected
apps in `openai-curated-remote`. Tool/category policies require authenticated
runtime discovery inside the Agent; the controller catalog still returns
`tools: null`. Unknown tool IDs or missing app ownership keep startup unready.
Nothing is enabled by default. Linear and Google Calendar are test fixtures,
not a production allowlist.

Translation requires an OpenClaw Codex bridge that preserves native app/tool
policy. The runtime image and normal Agent flow still need verification; see
[native mappings and limits](drivers/plugin-bundled.md#native-mappings-and-limits)
and [current proof notes](../testing/plugins.md#current-proof-notes).

## Lifecycle

Adding a plugin to the Agent requests installation on deployment; it does not
install a package in the controller or running Agent. Setting `enabled: false`
keeps the selection but blocks it where the runtime supports that policy.
Removing the entry clears the selection. Neither operation immediately revokes
an active tool or interrupts a turn.

Deployment freezes requested selections and owning Driver identity in the
AgentRevision. It does not freeze resolved Codex release identity, app mapping,
or rendered native configuration. Startup resolves current curated metadata and
translates it inside the Agent workload, so a retry or restart can resolve a
later curated release for the same requested catalog ID. Kubernetes retains the
native OpenClaw installation registry in the Agent-owned state database; the
existing serialized gateway replacement prevents old and new revisions from
installing concurrently. The Agent workspace retains its existing lifecycle.
Failed catalog resolution, policy translation, integrity verification, or core
authentication keeps the candidate unready. A confirmed selected-plugin install
rejection or plugin authentication requirement disables that selection while
other successfully prepared plugins can serve. Ordinary retirement removes
old workload state, but does not delete the Agent-owned database.

Read `Agent.plugins` for saved selections and the AgentRevision for the
selections requested by that deployment. Check
[deployment status](agents.md#deployment-status) for startup results.
`activeRevisionId` is not evidence that installation succeeded: the worker
records it before runtime activation completes. Saved selections remain
readable if the catalog entry or Driver disappears.

For Compute-owned Kubernetes embedded OpenClaw and dedicated Codex workloads,
a selected native install rejection produces a `PLUGIN_INSTALL_FAILED` warning.
A successful Codex install response with apps that still need authentication
produces `PLUGIN_AUTH_REQUIRED`. Deployment can succeed with these warnings once
the failed selections are explicitly disabled in the effective native and
gateway configuration. Warnings contain only the admitted selection key and a
closed code; native error text and credentials are never returned.

The requested plugin map remains unchanged. Startup creates an effective map
that disables failed selections and preserves successful selections' policies.
Dedicated Codex also blocks failed gateway bridge entries so the gateway cannot
retry their installation during a turn. Runtime restarts recompute the result
and refresh the effective configuration before serving. Failure to apply or
verify that configuration remains fatal. Transport loss, timeouts, malformed
native responses, signals, and unrelated startup failures remain unattributed
startup failures. Provider-owned Harnesses and non-Kubernetes Compute paths
retain their existing generic startup-failure behavior.

SSH Compute currently supports plugin-free embedded OpenClaw only. A revision
with any nonempty requested plugin map is rejected before SSH host effects,
including when a PluginDriver is selected.

## HTTP operations

Plugin selections are managed through the existing Agent create/update API.
There is no separate plugin resource, install/delete endpoint, policy mutation
endpoint, or plugin-tool invocation endpoint.

| Method and path                                  | Body                                          | Successful response                            |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `POST /namespaces/:namespaceId/agents`           | Agent create body with optional `plugins` map | `201`, Agent response containing the saved map |
| `PATCH /namespaces/:namespaceId/agents/:agentId` | Agent update body with optional `plugins` map | `200`, Agent response containing the saved map |

Every Agent update must include `configurationId`, even when only plugins
change. Agent creation also requires `name`. See the
[Agent request contract](agents.md#editable-configuration).

Agent creation requires Agent `create` on the Namespace and the existing exact
Configuration and ServiceAccount reads. Agent update requires exact-Agent
`update` plus the existing exact Configuration and ServiceAccount reads.
Agent GET requires exact-Agent `read`. Existing Namespace and resource
checks apply.

### Request fields

Use a Driver-qualified curated plugin ID that matches the identifier grammar.
Catalog membership is resolved at Agent startup. Plugin IDs are 1-253
characters matching `^[A-Za-z0-9._~:@-]+$`. Tool IDs use the same length and
characters, with `/` also allowed for exact native tool names. Callers cannot
submit a plugin's native identity, Driver identity, source, version, or arbitrary
settings. Request
objects reject unknown fields. `plugins:null` is invalid.

On Agent create, an absent `plugins` field and `{}` both mean no desired user
plugins. On Agent update, omitting `plugins` preserves the existing map, `{}` clears
all desired plugins, and any nonempty object replaces the whole map. The update
does not merge plugin entries or nested tool policies.

In the tables below, **mode** means `always`, `never`, `prompt`, or `auto`.
Structural validity does not imply native support; startup validates the
complete requested selection against the selected Driver and native runtime.

| Plugin map value field        | Type                             | Behavior                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`                     | Boolean                          | Required plugin enablement intent.                                         |
| `approvalMode`                | Mode                             | Required plugin default.                                                   |
| `approvalsReviewer`           | Optional `user` or `auto_review` | Omission inherits native review settings.                                  |
| `destructiveActions`          | Optional mode                    | Category override applied at startup when native metadata supports it.     |
| `writes`                      | Optional mode                    | Category override applied at startup when native metadata supports it.     |
| `tools`                       | Optional object keyed by tool ID | Tool overrides applied at startup when authoritative metadata supports it. |
| `tools.<toolId>.enabled`      | Optional Boolean                 | Explicit tool enablement override.                                         |
| `tools.<toolId>.approvalMode` | Optional mode                    | Explicit tool approval override.                                           |

Each supplied tool override must contain `enabled`, `approvalMode`, or both.
Omitted optional fields inherit the plugin/category/native policy. To remove an
optional override, replace the plugin entry without that field. To remove one
tool override, replace the `tools` map without that tool ID. To remove all
plugin selections, update the Agent with `"plugins": {}`.

For example, update an Agent with the available OpenClaw entry, using the
Agent's current Configuration ID, then explicitly deploy the Agent:

```json
{
  "configurationId": "cfg_123e4567-e89b-42d3-a456-426614174000",
  "plugins": {
    "occ-plugin:diffs": {
      "enabled": true,
      "approvalMode": "always"
    }
  }
}
```

A later Agent update can disable that selection without deleting it:

```json
{
  "configurationId": "cfg_123e4567-e89b-42d3-a456-426614174000",
  "plugins": {
    "occ-plugin:diffs": {
      "enabled": false,
      "approvalMode": "always"
    }
  }
}
```

The following illustrates the nested request shape only. The current Diffs
catalog lacks tool metadata, so the API can save this request, but the
deployment will not become ready:

```json
{
  "configurationId": "cfg_123e4567-e89b-42d3-a456-426614174000",
  "plugins": {
    "occ-plugin:diffs": {
      "enabled": true,
      "approvalMode": "always",
      "destructiveActions": "never",
      "writes": "prompt",
      "tools": {
        "example_tool": { "enabled": true, "approvalMode": "always" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Response fields

Agent GET, create, and update return saved selections under `data.plugins`.
Existing revision and deployment-status reads describe the deployed request and
startup outcome. Successful Agent mutations and authorization denials retain
attributable audit evidence.

The [Agent reference](agents.md#deployment-status) owns generic deployment
polling. Plugin failure responses use fixed platform messages and include only
the admitted plugin ID in `error.data`. Native text, command output,
credentials, claim tokens, and workload paths are never returned.

### Agent and revision plugin fields

[Agent responses](agents.md) optionally include `plugins`, an object keyed by
plugin ID whose values are the desired selections above. An absent or empty map
means no desired selections. These fields are managed through Agent
create/update bodies.

[AgentRevision responses](api.md) optionally include a `plugins` snapshot with
the following fields. This is admitted deployment state, not another mutation
body. It freezes requested state, not resolved native release metadata.

| Revision `plugins` field | Type                      | Meaning                                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `driver`                 | Driver identity object    | Required `id` and `implementation` strings.            |
| `plugins`                | Object keyed by plugin ID | Frozen requested selections, matching `Agent.plugins`. |

At startup, Codex translation uses native Codex app settings and, when a
supported curated Codex app is selected, OpenClaw Codex bridge configuration.
The active native configuration sets the selected app entry to `enabled:true`
and optional native `approvals_reviewer`, translated from Enterprise
`approvalsReviewer`. The bridge configuration sets
`plugins.entries.codex.config.codexPlugins.enabled` to true, keeps
`allow_all_plugins:false`, and includes one entry per selected plugin. Empty
desired state keeps apps/plugins disabled.

### Verification boundary

Source, schema, and fixture tests establish API and translation behavior. Native
runtime compatibility requires opt-in Kubernetes proof with a real Agent turn,
followed by a later deployment that disables or removes the selection and leaves
another Agent unchanged. Contributor fixture setup, service-account boundaries,
and current proof notes live in [Agent plugin testing](../testing/plugins.md).

This page documents the nested plugin wire contract. The
[generated API reference](api.md) summarizes routes and top-level schemas;
[request schemas](../../packages/contracts/src/api/common.ts) and
[response schemas](../../packages/contracts/src/api/resources.ts) are the
executable definitions.

## Approval policy

| `approvalMode` | Requested behavior                                                                        |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `always`       | No plugin approval step; authorization and other restrictions still apply.                |
| `never`        | Block tool execution.                                                                     |
| `prompt`       | Request review for each call through the effective reviewer.                              |
| `auto`         | Use native Codex annotation and remembered-approval behavior to decide whether to review. |

`approvalsReviewer` independently selects `user` or `auto_review`. It does not
force review: `auto` can skip review, while `prompt` requests review for every
call. An absent reviewer inherits the native setting.

For enabled tools, requested precedence is explicit tool mode, then the
stricter applicable category override, then the plugin default. Category
strictness is `never > prompt > auto > always`. Disabled plugins/tools cannot be
re-enabled by a mode override. Destructive means native `destructiveHint` is
not explicitly false; missing metadata is conservative. Writes means native
`readOnlyHint` is not explicitly true. Classification never uses a tool's name.

The API saves structurally valid policy without proving that the selected
Driver can represent it exactly. Startup performs that validation. See
[native mappings and current limits](drivers/plugin-bundled.md#native-mappings-and-limits).
The controller catalog returns `tools:null` for both bundled Drivers. Native
OpenClaw remains plugin-level only. Codex obtains tool identities and annotations
inside the authenticated Agent after installation; controller catalog metadata
is not required for this runtime translation. Tool policies inherit the plugin
reviewer; there is no separate per-tool reviewer field. Startup writes explicit
settings for observed tools and disables the default. Codex can still match a
new tool by its display title to an existing enabled policy key, so this does
not guarantee denial of every future tool. Exact future-tool protection requires
a Codex runtime change. The next runtime preparation rediscovers and reapplies
policy to the observed inventory.

## Failures and boundaries

- `400`: invalid body or identity/source fields.
- `403`: denied exact-Agent permission.
- `404`: missing or foreign Agent or Configuration.
- `409`: ordinary Agent conflict, such as duplicate name.
- `503`: temporarily unavailable platform dependency.

Errors use `{error,meta:{requestId}}`, with no top-level `data` field. The
[generated API reference](api.md) owns the full error envelope shape.

Structurally invalid Agent writes fail atomically before save. Catalog
membership, native metadata, and policy representability are startup concerns:
unsupported behavior is reported through the existing failed or unready
candidate path and does not change the earlier Agent write or deployment
response into HTTP 501. Authentication, installation, and transport failures
remain failures of those operations.

Namespace plugin configuration, arbitrary catalogs, importing an owner's Codex
configuration, plugin-specific settings/credential APIs, Code Mode, and new
plugin permission restrictions are outside this feature. Existing sandbox,
network, filesystem, managed policy, and authorization controls remain in force.
An approval setting does not grant filesystem access or isolate plugin code.
