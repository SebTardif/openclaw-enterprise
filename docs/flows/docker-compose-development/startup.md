# Docker Compose startup

Trace host preflight, database initialization, and API/worker startup. See the [parent flow](../docker-compose-development.md) for its context and overall sequence.

## Execution trace

### 1. scripts/dev-up: host preflight and runtime image selection

`scripts/dev-up:50`, `deploy/runtime`

The helper runs from the checkout root. It accepts an optional `--key-output`
destination and forwards arguments after `--` to Docker Compose, so native
Compose project names, profiles, and override files keep their normal
precedence. It requires Docker Engine, Docker Compose, `curl`, and Python 3,
then validates the effective Compose configuration without printing expanded
credentials.

If neither a shared runtime image nor separate gateway/Agent images are set,
the helper selects `openclaw-enterprise-runtime:quickstart` for this invocation.
It builds that default image from `deploy/runtime` only when the image is
missing. Custom image references must already exist; an incomplete custom
selection fails before startup is reported successful.

Existing tags are reused even after the runtime recipe changes. Operators
[rebuild and verify the image](../../../deploy/runtime/README.md#quickstart-image-selection-and-rebuilding)
explicitly to pick up package changes. The runtime recipe owns packaged channel
plugins and gateway/Codex compatibility checks; `dev-up` does not install
missing plugins or verify a model turn.

The development controller image also compiles the Go runtime-security module.
Set `GO_BASE_IMAGE` to an approved digest-pinned Go 1.26 or newer builder;
Compose passes this build argument to the native build stage. Its executable is
included in the controller image for OpenShell and identity diagnostics.

### 2. compose.yaml:services.postgres and services.migrate

`compose.yaml:services.postgres`, `compose.yaml:services.migrate`

Compose starts PostgreSQL first and keeps its data in the local
`occ_postgres_data` volume. Compose also declares `occ_configuration_data`, but
mounts it only into the controller for development Configuration documents. The
PostgreSQL service uses local-only administrator credentials to initialize the
database and the checked-in local SQL to create the less-privileged
`occ_migrator` and `occ_app` roles.

The migration service waits for PostgreSQL, connects with
`OCC_MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL`, and applies Drizzle migrations. The API and
worker never use the migrator or PostgreSQL administrator URL. `dev-up` invokes
this through Compose; it does not run migration directly.

### 3. Initialize before starting the API or worker

`compose.yaml:services.bootstrap`, `scripts/bootstrap-installation.mjs`

After migration exits `0`, Compose runs the shared initializer with development
inputs. Fresh bootstrap creates the development human administrator, the
non-Agent service administrator, the singleton Installation, native IAM seed,
audit evidence, and the initial service-key response. It also creates the
initial `default` Namespace in `provisioning` state and queues worker
reconciliation; the worker later provisions its backing Docker boundary.
Existing Installations retain their Namespaces, accounts, keys, IAM policy,
configuration, and revision history. Missing, expired, or revoked keys do not
trigger another bootstrap issue.

Only the initializer mounts `occ_bootstrap_data`; the API and worker load
committed state after initializer success. The
[bootstrap flow](../local-password-authentication.md) owns credentials, concurrent
attempts, and failure recovery.

### 4. The API admits only local development traffic

`apps/controller/src/server.mjs:start`,
`apps/controller/src/composition/development-postgres.ts:createDevelopmentConfigurationDriver`,
`apps/controller/src/drivers/configuration/filesystem/index.ts:FilesystemConfigurationDriver`

The API starts in `NODE_ENV=development`, binds inside the Compose network, and
publishes its host port only on `127.0.0.1`. `OCC_AUTH_SECRET` signs user
sessions and `OCC_AUTH_BASE_URL` fixes the cookie origin.

Development accepts the explicitly configured Compose bridge CIDR as local
control-plane traffic, while non-loopback clients, forwarded headers,
caller-supplied identity headers, bearer credentials, and trusted-proxy claims
remain rejected. The API uses the application-role PostgreSQL URL and never
receives the Docker socket.

After the controller health check passes, `dev-up` waits for the worker
readiness probe before copying the initializer-owned service-key JSON from the
stopped bootstrap container. `--key-output` must name an absent destination in a
private operator-owned directory; otherwise the helper creates a private
temporary directory. The helper never overwrites an existing local file, never
prints `data.key`, and never reruns bootstrap to replace a missing key.

`dev-up` then reads `/installation` with `scripts/occ-api` and the copied
service-key response. `apps/controller/src/auth/index.ts:ControllerAdmissionVerifier.verify`
validates the `x-api-key` and maps it to the Installation-scoped service
administrator; current IAM policy still authorizes each resource operation. The
startup proof succeeds only when the response returns HTTP `200` and `data.id`
matches the copied key response's `meta.installationId`. An invalid, expired,
or revoked key fails with `401` without cookie fallback. The
[service-key flow](../service-api-keys.md) owns admission details.

When `OCC_CONFIG_PATH` is absent, PostgreSQL-backed development selects the
filesystem Configuration Driver from `OCC_DEVELOPMENT_CONFIGURATION_ROOT`.
Compose sets that root to `/app/.development/configurations` and backs it with
the `occ_configuration_data` named volume. PostgreSQL remains the OCC metadata
system of record; native Configuration documents live in that driver-owned
volume.

### 5. The worker selects Docker compute and claims durable work

`apps/controller/src/worker.mjs:configuration`

The worker starts after the controller is healthy with the same
application-role `OCC_DATABASE_URL`. When `OCC_CONFIG_PATH` is absent in
development, it selects `compute-docker-development` with implementation
`docker-local`. Setting `OCC_CONFIG_PATH` explicitly selects the trusted Driver
set described by that file instead.

The worker loads the singleton Installation, validates persisted IAM policy,
and polls the PostgreSQL work queue. Startup readiness means the worker can
claim durable work; it does not mean an Agent, AgentRevision, or TUI exists.
Every claimed operation reauthorizes the original actor before calling Compute.
The worker is the only Compose service with Docker Engine access. It does not
mount the configuration volume.
