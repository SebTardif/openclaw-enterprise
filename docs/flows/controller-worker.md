# Controller Worker Flow

## Overview

The worker claims API-admitted PostgreSQL work, rechecks authorization, invokes
Compute, and persists results under its live claim. This trace follows Namespace,
Agent stop/deletion, and AgentRevision work. The
[controller reference](../reference/controller.md) owns the contract and the
[deployment guide](../guides/deploy.md) owns process setup.

## Entry Points

- Trigger: Compose or Helm starts `apps/controller/src/worker.mjs`; an
  authenticated API mutation commits Namespace, Agent lifecycle, or AgentRevision work.
- Source: `apps/controller/src/worker.mjs:configuration`,
  `apps/controller/src/worker.ts:ControllerWorker.start`, and
  `packages/occ/src/state/postgres-state.ts:operations.append`.
- Assumptions: The database is initialized and contains the singleton
  Installation; the API and worker use the same application-role database and
  selected Driver identities. Production supplies trusted Installation YAML.
  Each work record carries its original actor and exact resource ownership.

## Execution Trace

### 1. Initialize the independent worker process

`apps/controller/src/worker.mjs:configuration`,
`apps/controller/src/worker.ts:ControllerWorker.start`

The [entrypoint](../../apps/controller/src/worker.mjs) requires development or
production mode, a PostgreSQL URL, and positive worker timing values. It removes
an old readiness marker, loads trusted startup configuration, opens its own
application-role connection pool, and constructs `ControllerWorker`.
Development without `OCC_CONFIG_PATH` selects and preflights the Docker Compute
Driver. Production requires explicit startup configuration.

`start()` loads the already-bootstrapped Installation, validates persisted native
IAM state, and attaches selected Configuration, Sandbox, and IAM lifecycle hooks
to Compute. Shared startup composition supplies the optional Sandbox Driver to
the bundled Kubernetes Compute Driver. A selected hook requires Compute to
support `setLifecycleDrivers`; invalid or unavailable selected capabilities stop
startup. Production then runs Compute preflight before emitting `worker.started`
and starting `run()`.

The worker has no resource API.
Metrics use a private listener and one read-only database connection.
Concurrent scrapes share a
`packages/occ/src/state/postgres-metrics.ts:PostgresMetricsSnapshot.collect`
read of persisted lifecycle, backlog depth, and oldest age. This distinguishes
stopped from draft Agents without probing runtime health. Pass metrics follow
finalization independently of logging; see the [metrics contract](../reference/metrics.md).

### 2. Commit API admission and the durable work record

`apps/controller/src/index.ts:perform`,
`packages/occ/src/index.ts:OpenClawController`,
`packages/occ/src/state/postgres-state.ts:operations.append`

The API authenticates and authorizes the caller before invoking controller
operations such as `createNamespace`, `deleteNamespace`, `deployAgent`, `stopAgent`,
or `deleteAgent`.
`operations.append` verifies exact ownership and calls `PostgresWorkQueue.enqueue`
within the transaction. State, admission audit, and work commit or roll back together.

The queue freezes actor, Namespace owner, lifecycle target, and exact Agent and
immutable AgentRevision for revision work. Agent lifecycle work identifies its
Agent and `stopped` or `deleted` target without a revision. Reusing an idempotency
key with a different actor, owner, or target is rejected. The API returns accepted
state without waiting for Compute; the worker takes over.

### 3. Recover expired claims and claim one eligible operation

`apps/controller/src/worker.ts:ControllerWorker.run`,
`packages/occ/src/state/postgres-work-queue.ts:PostgresWorkQueue.claim`

Each loop first calls `recoverStale()`, then `claim()`. The
[PostgreSQL queue](../../packages/occ/src/state/postgres-work-queue.ts) selects
eligible queued work with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, assigns a fresh claim token
and lease deadline, and increments the attempt count. Another live claim for
the same Agent, or the Namespace for Namespace work, prevents concurrent
ownership of that target.

An empty queue causes a bounded idle delay. After processing or while idle,
`health()` queries pending work, refreshes readiness through `onHealthy`, and emits
`worker.health`. Readiness requires a successful queue-health query and callback.
Only one health update runs at a time; failures emit `HEALTH_UNAVAILABLE` without
consuming a work item's retry budget.

### 4. Reload ownership and reauthorize before infrastructure effects

`apps/controller/src/worker.ts:ControllerWorker.process`,
`apps/controller/src/worker.ts:ControllerWorker.processRevision`,
`apps/controller/src/worker.ts:ControllerWorker.authorizeRevision`

Namespace work reloads its exact resource and expected `provisioning` or
`deleting` status. Work whose target has already changed completes as
`SUPERSEDED_TARGET`. Otherwise `authorize()` reloads IAM state and checks the
original actor. Provisioning also checks restrictions on the exact Namespace;
placement into an existing Kubernetes namespace requires Installation
administration permission again.

Revision work reloads its Namespace, Agent, admitted revision, and current active
revision. `processRevision()` rejects mismatched owners, an unready Namespace,
an invalid Agent Principal, a changed Harness descriptor, or a different Compute
Driver identity. `authorizeRevision()` checks current `deploy` permission and,
when a ServiceAccount snapshot is present, current `read` permission for that
exact ServiceAccount. Admission-time permission does not substitute for these
checks. The worker then resolves the revision's frozen Provider metadata and
rechecks any managed credential's exact Provider, Driver, workspace, and issued
account binding before Compute effects. It uses a read-only projection and has
no Provider client or admin key. The
[Provider-managed credential delivery flow](service-account-driver-credential-delivery.md) owns these checks.

Revoked actors and denied operations become permanent results before runtime
creation. A revision older than the current active revision completes as
superseded; an already-active revision enters finalization or maintenance rather
than changing the active pointer again.

Agent-stop work rechecks current exact-Agent `operate`. Superseded desired state
completes without shutdown. An absent active pointer does not prove candidates
have no runtime resources, so stop still checks the captured revision history.

Agent-deletion work requires the Agent to remain `deleting` and stopped, then
rechecks the original actor's exact-Agent `delete`. It loads every owned revision
and rejects ownership or Compute-Driver mismatches before teardown.

### 5. Invoke Compute while renewing the live claim

`apps/controller/src/worker.ts:ControllerWorker.observe`,
`apps/controller/src/worker.ts:ControllerWorker.observeRevision`,
`apps/controller/src/worker.ts:ControllerWorker.withClaimHeartbeat`

Namespace dispatch calls `ensureNamespace` or `deleteNamespace`. Revision
dispatch optionally binds the exact Agent, then calls `prepareRevision` with its
immutable snapshot. The worker validates the returned observation's owner and
shape before treating it as ready. A pending observation defers convergence;
an invalid observation fails permanently.

Compute can also return safe plugin warnings for the current startup attempt.
The worker validates each closed code and admitted selection key against the
immutable revision. Warnings do not fail deployment; readiness means Compute
has already verified that failed selections are disabled. Missing or malformed
startup evidence cannot be interpreted as a safe successful installation.

Agent-stop dispatch captures the Agent's revisions owned by the current Compute
and validates their exact owner. It calls `stopRevision` for the active revision
first, then the remaining captured revisions, including terminal candidates and
predecessors whose retirement failed. Historical revisions pinned to another
Compute are excluded; an active revision pinned elsewhere still fails closed.
Before each shutdown, the worker rechecks the Agent owner and stopped desired
state. Later admissions are not added to this cleanup set. Partial failure retries
the idempotent shutdowns without clearing the active pointer or deleting retained
workspace data.

Before shutdown, the worker binds the server-owned Namespace and Agent. Stopped
revision recovery also binds before shutdown and retirement. IAM and exact
resource checks precede binding.
Revision preparation and maintenance recheck `desiredRuntimeState`; a candidate
that overlaps stop is shut down instead of activated.

Agent-deletion dispatch binds the server-owned Namespace and Agent before calling
`retireRevision` for every owned revision, then invokes the optional Agent
credential-deletion capability. This rebuilds Driver-local ownership after a
worker restart. A Driver that can provision runtime credentials but cannot delete
them fails permanently before binding or retirement. Compute retirement owns
workload termination and Sandbox cleanup; the worker does not invoke either
independently.

`withClaimHeartbeat()` renews before each effect and every third of the lease
duration, protecting sequences of short effects too. Lease loss, heartbeat failure,
or shutdown aborts Compute and raises `WorkClaimLostError`. Expired or replaced
claim tokens cannot publish results.

While Compute runs, successful renewals also request a throttled health update.
Neither starting an effect nor renewing its lease waits for that update: slow
readiness callbacks do not block the renewal promise chain. Health failure does not
imply lease loss; a failed claim heartbeat still aborts Compute.

Compute owns infrastructure dispatch and delegation to Sandbox; the worker
cannot create sandbox resources independently. See the
[Kubernetes implementation](../../apps/controller/src/drivers/compute/kubernetes/index.ts)
and [Docker execution flow](docker-compose-development.md).

### 6. Persist the result and finish revision activation

`apps/controller/src/worker.ts:ControllerWorker.finalize`,
`apps/controller/src/worker.ts:ControllerWorker.finalizeRevision`,
`apps/controller/src/worker.ts:ControllerWorker.completeActivatedRevision`

Finalization uses `transactWithQueue()` and renews the exact claim inside the
transaction before publishing state. Namespace success transitions provisioning
to ready or records completed deletion, appends lifecycle evidence, and completes
the queue item atomically. A failed provisioning target can transition to failed;
incomplete deletion does not publish successful deletion.

Revision activation crosses a separate infrastructure boundary. Once preparation
is ready, a Driver selecting `activationOrder: beforeCommit` activates before
the database pointer changes. Otherwise an implemented activation stage runs in both development and
production after the claim-protected compare-and-set of `Agent.activeRevisionId`; the first dedicated
revision is staged inactive until that commit. A changed active pointer causes
`ACTIVE_REVISION_CHANGED` and retry instead of overwriting a concurrent result.

After the pointer commit, the worker finishes required activation and retires
the predecessor. `completeActivatedRevision()` then rechecks the exact active
revision and claim, appends activation evidence, and completes work in a second
transaction. Infrastructure effects and database state are not atomic. Retried
finalization rechecks the already-active candidate before activation and
retirement, so a retained plugin failure cannot become success after claim loss.

Stop finalization rechecks the live claim, Agent owner, and stopped desired state.
After all captured cleanup succeeds, it clears `activeRevisionId` only when
it still equals the revision Compute stopped. A later deployment supersedes the
stop even if it retains that active pointer while preparing. It appends lifecycle-stop
evidence and completes the same work item. Revision rows and persistent runtime
state are not deleted.

After commit, `completeActivatedRevision()` and `finalizeAgentStop()` record
admission-to-completion duration through `apps/controller/src/metrics/index.ts:createOccMetrics`.
Queue waits and retries count; maintenance and superseded work do not.
Process death before observation can lose a sample.

Deletion finalization uses a restricted database function rather than the
generic queue completion path. In one transaction it validates the live claim,
removes the Agent's revisions, service principal, API keys, and exact IAM
references, records lifecycle-delete success, deletes the Agent, and removes its
work rows. An expired or replaced claim removes nothing; `occ_app` has no direct
table-level delete privilege for these records.
`finalizeAgentDeletion()` records committed `agent_delete` outcomes. Snapshots
count deleting Agents as `stopping`, permanent cleanup failures as `failed`,
and remove completed deletions from inventory.

### 7. Defer, retry, or stop and hand off the next iteration

`apps/controller/src/worker.ts:ControllerWorker.finalizeActiveRevision`,
`packages/occ/src/state/postgres-work-queue.ts:PostgresWorkQueue.defer`,
`packages/occ/src/state/postgres-work-queue.ts:PostgresWorkQueue.retry`

Pending convergence requeues work with backoff and restores the consumed attempt.
Dependency failures consume attempts within the retry budget. Permanent failures,
exhausted attempts, and the convergence deadline terminate work. See the
[controller reference](../reference/controller.md) for the supported outcomes
and the [settings reference](../reference/settings/operations.md#controller-worker-environment)
for their timing controls.

Terminal work rows store the overall `reason_code` and one optional `result_data`
object for success or failure details. Successful revision work stores
`{ warnings: [...] }`; a convergence deadline failure stores required
`timeoutMs` and optional `runtimeFailure` from the exact candidate runtime.
Compute observes cached startup results through its private status path,
including unready Harnesses without plugins, and verifies the Pod/container
incarnation after collection. It does not repeat the model probe. Missing or
invalidated evidence leaves the cause unspecified.

`packages/occ/src/state/controller-work.ts:validateFailureData` validates reads
and writes; the PostgreSQL constraint enforces the matching persisted shape.
Other failure reasons still reject data.
`PostgresWorkQueue.complete` and `PostgresWorkQueue.fail` publish that data under
the live claim. The deployment status projection derives its separate `error`
and `warnings` fields from the saved result. Stale claims cannot publish outcomes or warnings. Completion needs no
runtime receipt acknowledgment or post-commit cleanup protocol. The original
deployment's warnings remain a historical startup result; later maintenance
observations do not rewrite that completed deployment.

Deployment GET requires exact revision `read` access and reads only durable
state, surviving Pod deletion and controller restart. Queued, running, and
successful deployments have no failure error. See [deployment status](../reference/agents.md#deployment-status).

Legacy terminal work rows derive `reason_code` from durable audit evidence.
A successful revision is marked `REVISION_ACTIVATED` only
when a matching activation audit event exists between work creation and
completion. Otherwise, the backfill copies the matching terminal `reconcile`
audit reason for the same resource, actor, attempt, outcome, and completion
window. If that evidence is absent, the row receives `LEGACY_OUTCOME_UNKNOWN`.
Historical `result_data` remains `NULL`, because previous rows did not store
structured timeout or warning data. Pending rows stay incomplete with no
terminal outcome.

If Compute declares a maintenance interval, successful activation schedules
another exact-revision observation. An incomplete active-runtime observation or
Compute binding closes the bounded item and schedules another so that a provider
outage does not abandon reconciliation of an authorized active runtime.
Each new claim reauthorizes its original actor. The next maintenance key uses a
strictly later time bucket than the current claim, preventing clock skew from
colliding with completed work and silently dropping its successor.

`worker.completed` reports the target, outcome, and code; polling then continues.
Lease loss is reported as `worker.error` with `CLAIM_LOST` rather than publishing
stale lifecycle state. On `SIGTERM` or `SIGINT`, shutdown removes readiness,
aborts in-flight work, waits for the loop, closes PostgreSQL, and emits
`worker.stopped`. Expired unfinished claims are recoverable by a later worker.

## Debugging and Verification

- `worker.started` identifies the selected `computeDriverId` and optional
  `sandboxDriverId`. `worker.health` with `status: ready` reports a successful
  pending-work query. Neither event proves an Agent model turn.
- `worker.startup-error` precedes processing when the mode, database,
  Installation, Driver selection, or preflight is invalid. The worker has no
  HTTP health endpoint; packaged probes inspect the private readiness marker.
- When accepted operations stay queued, compare the API and worker database and
  Installation configuration, then inspect `worker.completed` outcomes and
  `worker.error`. `ACTOR_REVOKED` and `AUTHORIZATION_DENIED` require checking
  current IAM state; `DEPENDENCY_UNAVAILABLE` identifies retryable dispatch
  failure; `CLAIM_LOST` means the worker no longer owns publication.
- [Revision](../../tests/integration/postgres-worker-agent-revision.test.mjs) and
  [stale-claim](../../tests/integration/postgres-worker-stale-claim.test.mjs) tests
  require PostgreSQL; neither proves real model execution.
- [Sandbox startup](../../tests/integration/sandbox-driver-startup.test.mjs) tests
  verify composition; [k3d integration](../../tests/integration/sandbox-driver-openshell-k3d-real.test.mjs)
  verifies real infrastructure.
