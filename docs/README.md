# OpenClaw Enterprise

Deploy and manage Agents through OpenClaw Control Plane (OCC).
Start locally, install a production control plane, or look up supported behavior.

Use the [`integration/dev` overview](integration-dev-overview.md) for the accumulated
branch scope and remaining composition work. Component libraries and recorded
checks do not establish complete production runtime acceptance.

## Start and deploy

- [Quickstart](guides/quickstart.md): start locally, sign in, and verify API access.
- [Deploy](guides/deploy.md): choose a deployment and follow its installation steps.
- [Concepts](guides/concepts.md): understand Namespaces, Agents, revisions, and credentials.
- [Observability](guides/observability.md): export logs and check Collector health.

## Reference

Use the [feature and Driver index](reference/README.md) for supported behavior,
configuration, and limits. The [HTTP API](reference/api.md) describes request and
response schemas. The [console guide](reference/console.md) covers browser tasks.

## Architecture

Read [current architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) for implemented components and
ownership. The [platform design](design.md) describes the authoritative target,
including capabilities that have not shipped.

## Understand the code

Start with [platform startup](flows/platform-startup.md) or the
[controller worker](flows/controller-worker.md). The **Understand the code** tab
lists runtime traces for authentication, configuration, Drivers, and Agent execution.
See also the [operator workflow](flows/operator-workflow.md),
[channel delivery](flows/channel-delivery.md), and
[lifecycle recovery guide](guides/lifecycle-recovery.md) for current admission and recovery boundaries.

## Contribute

- [Testing](testing/README.md): select a suite and prepare its environment.
- [Development verification loop](development-loop.md): focused checks, isolated worktrees, and handoff evidence.
- [Local preview](local-preview.md): render and validate documentation.

## Implementation history

The [spec archive](../specs/README.md) preserves proposals and delivery records.
Recorded statuses do not replace current feature reference.
